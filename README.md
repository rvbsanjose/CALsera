## What is CALsera?
> CALsera is a way to track your weekly schedule, showing what potential schedule conflicts you would have if you enrolled in Coursera courses.

## Is there a sprint board?
Yes. You can find the ongoing sprint board at https://github.com/rvbsanjose/CALsera/projects/1. It is meant to mimick a Jira board of tickets (Github issues) moving from left to right, TODO -> In Progress -> Ready for Code Review -> Done. Since CALsera is developed by a sole engineer, that engineer will code review himself :).
